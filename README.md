# final-project

This is a template repository for final projects for EcoEvoTheory Fall 2022.

## Instructions (do this before class Monday, Nov. 28!)

For more detailed instructions see [here](https://github.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/final-project/blob/main/how_to_fork.md).

1.  Fork this repository to your personal GitHub account.
2.  Either clone it to your computer, or use the edit button to update this README with your project proposal (below).

## Project Proposal

## Name(s) of the folks involved in this project: 
Lola Holcomb

## Working title: 
Applying Neutral Theory to the Gut: How Do Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Broccoli Bioactives Affect Gut Microbial Ecology?

## Project summary (1-2 sentences): 
In this project I will be using neutral theory and/or other biodiversity metrics as a lens to study large 16S bacterial datasets in attempt to better understand how broccoli, as a dietary intervention for IBD, affects gut microbial ecology. 

## What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?: 
There is still so much unknown about gut microbial ecology. Over the last few years, mainstream media has begun to highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in digestive funciton and overall health and wellbeing, but the sort of "behaviors" of gut microbiota are still relatively unstudied. We know gut microbes are important, but we don't really know how the behave, fluctuate, move and travel, and in some cases, we don't really know which microbes do what. I'm interested in applying ecological theories to gut microbiota because I'd like to see if doing so gives us some more insight to the behaviors of these gut microbes we know to be important, but about which we don't know too much else.

## How do you plan to tackle this project?: 
I will be using RStudio to perform various analyses and create visuals of alpha and beta diversity metrics from large 16S datasets.
Specific goals include (but are not limited to):
- Write some R code that allows me to crunch my metadata into Neutral Theory (and/or other models)
- Develop 2-4 meaningful figures 
- Translate what I see from the figures generated, and/or what I acquire from statistical testing, into a cohesive Disscussion-section-like piece of writing. I'm always looking to practice scientific writing!

## What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?: 
R codes and my newly acquired knowledge of neutral theory and other theories of biodiversity. 

## What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?: 
I think I have the code and data I need for this project; I just need to do some literature searching to better understand what I'm doing, and why I'm doing it.

## How can Andy or Renata help?: 
I'll probably have some questions (that I'll send via email) throughout my work, if you'd be so kind as to provide guidance.
